## III. Exploring the Dataset

### Query 01: Calculate Quantity of items, Sales value and Order quantity by each Subcategory in  last 12 months

```sql
WITH the_last_day AS (
    SELECT DATE(MAX(ModifiedDate))AS last_day	
      FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`)

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC(DATE(a.ModifiedDate), MONTH) AS period -- Convert ModifiedDate to DATE
    ,c.name
    ,SUM(a.OrderQty) AS qt_item
    ,ROUND(SUM(a.LineTotal),2) AS total_sales
    ,COUNT(DISTINCT a.SalesOrderID) AS order_cnt
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` AS b
    ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS c
    ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID 
WHERE DATE(a.ModifiedDate) >= (SELECT last_day FROM the_last_day) - INTERVAL 12 MONTH									
GROUP BY 1, 2									
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 2 ASC;
```

ðŸš€ The data shows that Road, Mountain, and Touring Bikes generate the highest revenue and sales volume. Among accessories, Helmets, Jerseys, and Tires have the highest unit sales. While overall sales have remained relatively stable across the quarters, there was a sharp decline in Q2 2014, primarily driven by a significant drop in June 2014.


### Query 02: Calculate % YoY growth rate by SubCategory and release top 3 catergories with highest grow rate

```sql
WITH 
sale_info AS (
  SELECT 
      FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%Y", a.ModifiedDate) AS year
      , c.Name
      , SUM(a.OrderQty) AS qty_item

  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` a 
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` b 
    ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
  LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` c 
    ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID
  GROUP BY 1,2
  ORDER BY 2 ASC , 1 DESC
),

get_growth_rate AS (
  SELECT *
  , LEAD (qty_item) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY year DESC) AS prv_qty
  , ROUND(qty_item / (LEAD (qty_item) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY year DESC)) -1,2) as growth_rate
  FROM sale_info
  ORDER BY 5 DESC
),

rank_growth_rate AS (
  SELECT *
      ,DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY growth_rate DESC) AS ranking
  FROM get_growth_rate 
)

SELECT DISTINCT Name
      , year
      , qty_item
      , prv_qty
      , growth_rate
      , ranking
FROM rank_growth_rate
WHERE ranking <=3
ORDER BY ranking;
```

ðŸš€ From 2011 to 2014, the accessories category saw the highest year-over-year volume growth, led by Mountain Frames (2012), Socks (2013), and Road Frames (2012), which surged by 521%, 421%, and 389%, respectively. This significant growth can probably stem from expansion into new markets, product improvements, or a shift in consumer preferences. Understanding the key factors behind this trend is essential for sustaining growth and replicating success across other product lines.


### Query 03: Ranking Top 3 TeritoryID with biggest Order quantity of every year. 

```sql
WITH count_order AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT (YEAR FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS Year
        ,c.TerritoryID
        ,SUM(a.OrderQty) AS order_cnt
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader` AS b ON a.SalesOrderID  = b.SalesOrderID 
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesTerritory` AS c ON b.TerritoryID = c.TerritoryID
    GROUP BY 1,2)

, get_ranking AS(
    SELECT 
        *
        ,DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Year ORDER BY order_cnt DESC) AS ranking
    FROM count_order
    ORDER BY 1 DESC)

SELECT *
FROM get_ranking
WHERE ranking <4;
```

<img width="543" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-04 at 10 05 01 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c837acc9-2a9d-409b-9a73-1ed0bd231ce9" />

ðŸš€ Regarding geographic performance, the top three territories with the highest sales orders from 2011 to 2014 were TerritoryIDs 4, 6, and 1, maintaining their leading positions throughout the period. While overall order volume experienced significant growth, 2014 saw a sharp decrease. 
It is essential to examine the causes of this downturn and implement appropriate solutions. Additionally, the company should consider replicating the successful strategies of these territories in other regions.


### Query 04: Calculate Total Discount Cost belongs to Seasonal Discount for each SubCategory

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT (YEAR FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS Year
    ,c.name AS Name
    ,SUM(a.OrderQty) AS total_quantity
    ,ROUND(SUM(a.OrderQty*a.UnitPrice),2) AS revenue
    ,ROUND(SUM(d.DiscountPct * a.OrderQty*a.UnitPrice),2) AS total_discount_cost
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` AS b ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS c ON CAST(b.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT) = c.ProductSubcategoryID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Sales.SpecialOffer` AS d ON a.SpecialOfferID = d.SpecialOfferID
WHERE lower(d.Type) LIKE '%seasonal discount%' 
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

<img width="692" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-04 at 1 30 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c7a64ad-c0ae-4ac7-9186-e213ead3e0c0" />

ðŸš€ The company ran the Seasonal Discounts campaign exclusively for the Helmets subcategory in 2012 and 2013. In 2013, this promotion resulted in a 29% increase in helmet sales compared to 2012. However, the total discount nearly doubled, increasing from $827.65 in 2012 to $1,606.04 in 2013.


### Query 05: Retention rate of Customer in 2014 with status of Successfully Shipped (Cohort Analysis) 

```sql
WITH
info AS (
  SELECT   
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ModifiedDate) AS month_no
      , CustomerID
      , count(DISTINCT SalesOrderID) AS order_cnt
  FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderHeader`
  WHERE FORMAT_TIMESTAMP("%Y", ModifiedDate) = '2014'
  AND Status = 5
  GROUP BY 1,2
  ORDER BY 3,1)

, row_num AS (
  SELECT  *
      , ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY month_no) AS row_numb
  FROM info )

, first_order AS (
  SELECT  *
  FROM row_num
  WHERE row_numb = 1) 

, month_gap AS (
  SELECT  
      a.CustomerID
      , b.month_no AS month_join
      , a.month_no AS month_order
      , a.order_cnt
      , concat('M - ',a.month_no - b.month_no) AS month_diff
  FROM info a 
  LEFT JOIN first_order b 
  ON a.CustomerID = b.CustomerID
  ORDER BY 1,3)

, cohort_data AS(
  SELECT  month_join
      , month_diff 
      , count(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS customer_cnt
      , FIRST_VALUE(count(DISTINCT CustomerID)) OVER (PARTITION BY month_join ORDER BY month_join) AS initial_customer_cnt
  FROM month_gap
  GROUP BY 1,2
  ORDER BY 1,2)

SELECT
    month_join
    , month_diff 
    , customer_cnt
    -- Calculate the retention rate as (customer_cnt / initial_customer_cnt) * 100
    ,ROUND((customer_cnt * 100.0) / initial_customer_cnt, 2) AS retention_rate_percentage
FROM
    cohort_data
ORDER BY
     1,2;
```

<img width="467" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-04 at 2 13 51 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02e83b93-2d15-4edd-8b74-efc01a3536f1" />

- ðŸš€ The number of new customers fluctuated slightly in the first 5 months, then significantly declined in the following two months. 
- ðŸš€ Retention rates drop quickly across all cohorts, with only 2.83% of February's customers remaining after 1 month, and just 0.44% by month 5. This suggests most users don't find long-term value or engagement with the service.


### Query 06: Trend of Stock level & MoM diff % by all product in 2011. If % growth rate is null then 0.

```sql
WITH get_stock_qty AS (
    SELECT
        b.Name
        ,EXTRACT (MONTH FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS Month
        ,EXTRACT (YEAR FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS Year
        ,SUM(a.StockedQty) AS Stock_qty
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.WorkOrder`  AS a
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product`AS b
        ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
    WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM a.ModifiedDate) = 2011
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
    ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 DESC)

,get_stock_previous AS (
    SELECT *
        ,LEAD(Stock_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY Month DESC) AS Stock_pre
    FROM get_stock_qty 
    ORDER BY Name, Month DESC)

SELECT *
    ,ROUND(COALESCE((Stock_qty/Stock_pre -1)*100,0),1) AS diff 
FROM get_stock_previous
WHERE Stock_pre >0;
```
<img width="668" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-04 at 10 13 58 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a311ebd1-2d6f-4122-8c8b-40fb73a51a91" />

ðŸš€ In the last six months of 2011, product stock levels experienced frequent and significant fluctuations. Notably, inventory surged in October and July before sharply declining in the following months, indicating potential challenges in supply chain and inventory management efficiency. December stock declines across all products may be linked to year-end sales or reduced restocking due to seasonal trends.


### Query 07: Calculate Ratio of Stock / Sales in 2011 by product name, by month

```sql
WITH sales_info AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS Month
        ,EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.ModifiedDate) AS Year
        ,a.ProductID
        ,b.Name
        ,SUM(a.OrderQty) AS Sales
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS a
    LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` AS b
        ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.ModifiedDate)= 2011
    GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
    ORDER BY 1 DESC)

, stocks_info AS (
    SELECT 
        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ModifiedDate) AS Month
        ,EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ModifiedDate) AS Year
        ,ProductID
        ,SUM(StockedQty) AS Stock_quantity
    FROM `adventureworks2019.Production.WorkOrder` 
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ModifiedDate)= 2011
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
    ORDER BY 1 DESC)

  SELECT 
      a.*
      ,b.Stock_quantity AS Stock
      ,ROUND(COALESCE(b.Stock_quantity,0)/a.Sales,1) AS Ratio
  FROM sales_info AS a
  LEFT JOIN stocks_info AS b
      ON a.ProductID = b.ProductID
  AND a.Month = b.Month
  AND a.Year = b.Year
  ORDER BY 1 DESC, 7 DESC;
```

<img width="825" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-04 at 10 15 41 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cef9e2e-6833-4f9a-84af-8ce39c288b18" />

ðŸš€ The stock-to-sales ratio highlights inefficiencies in the company's inventory management. Low-selling products have excessively high ratios, driving up inventory costs, while high-selling products have low or zero ratios, increasing the risk of stockouts and lost sales. To enhance capital efficiency, the company should refine its inventory strategy, focusing on balancing stock levels.


### Query 08: Number of order and value at Pending status in 2014

```sql
SELECT 
        EXTRACT (YEAR FROM OrderDate) AS Year
        ,Status
        ,COUNT(DISTINCT PurchaseOrderID)AS order_count
        ,ROUND(SUM(TotalDue),2) AS value
 FROM `adventureworks2019.Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader` 
 WHERE EXTRACT (YEAR FROM OrderDate) = 2014
      AND Status = 1
GROUP BY 1,2;
```

<img width="545" alt="Screen Shot 2025-03-04 at 10 16 13 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ece49e92-bda6-41f2-80bc-6bc1f46aca62" />

ðŸš€ In 2014, there were 224 pending orders totaling $3,873,579, with an average order value of $17,292.76. This  indicates that pending orders may involve bulk purchases or high-value transactions. Given the significant impact on revenue and customer satisfaction, it is essential to further investigate the factors causing delays.
